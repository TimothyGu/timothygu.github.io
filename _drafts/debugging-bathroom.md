## How It All Started

Since sometime in the last two months, my bathroom (shared with my host
"brother") *sink* became inhabited by ants. Yes, ants, in the *sink*. Doubly
gross. At first, I tried to eliminate them by hand -- flush them down the sink
when and only when I see them. As you can imagine, it didn't work superbly.
Ants just seem to keep coming from nowhere.

So, I told my host brother and my host mom about it. I am not sure what they
did or even *if* they did anything, but the ants population, or at least the
population of those dumb enough to come out when I am there, seemed to
decline. I was like "WTH" and kept using it and continued my original
strategy.

## When It Got Worse

Since about yesterday or so, the number of ants skyrocketed (don't ask me
why).
