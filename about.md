Hi there, I am Timothy Gu (although you probably already know me by now). I am
a current student at [Santa Margarita Catholic High School](http://www.smhs.org).

I do most things you can think of that are computer-related, including:

- C, Java, Perl
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Timothy_Gu)
- [GitHub pages](https://timothygu.github.io/)
- [PIxEL Clubs](//pixelclubs.org), a high school club dedicated for further
  web technology
- Vector logo [dra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ListFiles/Timothy_Gu)[wing](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:ListFiles/Timothy_Gu&ilshowall=1)
- Website designing and restyling
- GNU Make, CMake, Unix Shell ("bash")
- [Cross-compiling projects from Linux to Win32](http://mxe.cc)
- JavaScript ([Node.js](https://github.com/orgs/jadejs/people) mostly, but
  occasionally some jQuery stuff too)
- Texinfo
- Last but not least, [xkcd](https://xkcd.com)

I also do many non-CS-related things (what a surprise!):

- Classical guitar
- Sailing in local lakes
- Golfing
- Fixing tallships at the [Ocean Institute](http://ocean-institute.org)
- Español
- 中文
