Hi there, I am Timothy Gu (although you probably already know me by now).
I am a current student at [Santa Margarita Catholic High School](http://www.smhs.org)
(sorry for the ugly website, itâ€™s not my fault).

I do most things you can think of that are computer-related, including:

- C, Java, Perl
- GNU Make, CMake, UNIX Shell
- JavaScript (both Node.js and browser), some jQuery
- Texinfo
- Wikipedia
- GitHub pages
- xkcd

I also do many non-CS-related things (what a surprise!):

- TODO
