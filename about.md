Hi there, I am Timothy Gu (although you probably already know me by now). I am a current student at [Santa Margarita Catholic High School](http://www.smhs.org) (sorry for the ugly website, it’s not my fault).

I do most things you can think of that are computer-related, including:

- C, Java, Perl
- [Wikipedia](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Timothy_Gu)
- [GitHub pages](//timothygu.github.io/)
- [PIxEL Clubs](//pixelclubs.org), a high school club dedicated for further web technology
- Vector logo [dra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ListFiles/Timothy_Gu)[wing](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:ListFiles/Timothy_Gu&ilshowall=1)
- Website designing and restyling
- GNU Make, CMake, UNIX Shell
- [Cross-compiling projects from Linux to Win32](http://mxe.cc)
- JavaScript ([Node.js](https://github.com/orgs/jadejs/people) mostly, but occasionally some jQuery stuff)
- Texinfo
- Last but not least, [xkcd](//xkcd.com)

I also do many non-CS-related things (what a surprise!):

- Classical guitar
- Sailing in local lakes
- Golf
- Español
- 中文
- CAP dumbbells
- Folding umbrellas
- (Occasionally) hacking random number generators in cheapo calculators. Oh wait, is this the non-CS-related list? Dam.

## SMCHS Students special

My friend [Ethan Lee](//ethanl.ee) has been very kind and created a collection of [study materials](http://ethanl.ee/school/) for the upcoming semester final. It's tomorrow, remember?
